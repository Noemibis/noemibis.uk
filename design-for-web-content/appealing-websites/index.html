         <h1>Appealing Web sites</h1>
         <p>This post should be very useful in terms of websites. 
         <br>I would suggest you some good pages that for me are truly interesting to use.<br> They are so different each other and made to different purposes but each of them is so easy to use.</p>

               <h2>Ororo.tv.com</h2>
               <img class="left" src="img/ororo.jpg" alt="ororo.logo"/>
                     <p>Ororo.tv is my favourite website. It&#180;s so useful for who is learning or improving English.
                      Basically is a public offer on selling electronic subscriptions for viewing TV series with subtitles and an embedded translator.</p>
         
                         <h3>Easy Access</h3>
                           <p>Start to use it is very easy, you need just to go on &#8220;Log in&#8221; and access to your own email or social account. The site doesn&#180;t ask you to create any password or a new account with long data to write. Also, it doesn&#180;t force you to do the subscription and doesn’t need any sensible data as your credit card number (in case of they will need). So this is fantastic because isn&#180;t annoying, is fast to access and easy to enjoy.</p>

                        <h3>Easy to use</h3>
                           <p>After the first step, you can use the website for one hour for free or if you want to use it more you       should have a subscription.
                               Use the search bar to search your favourite season or basically you can see all the seasons on the homepage. When you find something that you want to watch you can add it on your favourite seasons. If you do that anytime you’ll want to watch the same film you can get it with just a click on the &#8220;start &#8221;.</p>

                          <h3>Useful to learn</h3>
                             <p>During the watching of your seasons, you can help yourself with different languages on the subtitles.
                                The English one subtitle is always fixed, but if you want you can add other languages. Also, you can speed up or slow down the audio it&#180;ll allow you to understand easily the speaking part.</p>

                          <p>During my last year, since when I&#180;ve moved in Uk I started to use this website. It&#180;s so interesting because I can find there all I wish to have a good trip and is always so exact. But what made thetrainline.com so nice?</p>

                          <p>Duolingo is a good website to learn languages.
                             If you are looking for something that allows you to learn as a game, this is the best website I know.
                             It gives everyone access to a private tutor experience through technology and all of that it&#180;s free.</p>
         
                         <h3>Well structured</h3>
                           <p>This website is a masterpiece of style. It&#180;s hard to stay motivated when you are learning online but how they made it&#180;s amazing. I really like the graphics they are used, it&#180;s so simple, colourful and nice to discover. It doesn&#180;t represent a long and boring page but it&#180;s medium size and very dynamic.
                           It&#180;s composed of graphics draws that seems very friendly with the target. I like this type of style it makes me comfortable.
                           Also, the structure allows understanding what you are going to do, what are the key points and where is the information that I need.</p>

                        <h3>Easy using</h3>
                           <p>To get started you&#180;ll need just to click "get started" after you&#180;ll choose the language that you want to learn and finally the daily goal that you want to achieve.
                            Now you can start your "game" with lots of images, words and categories. Every day you will game with it to learn more and more and, at the end of the period that you already signed before, you&#180;ll learn a new language.
                            However, if it&#180;s not enough you can discover other options. For example, Duolingo Stories uses dialogue to help intermediate and advanced learners improve their reading, listening, and comprehension skills. If you want you can connect with other Duolingo learners around you in real life! Practice your communication skills and meet members of the Duolingo community.</p>
