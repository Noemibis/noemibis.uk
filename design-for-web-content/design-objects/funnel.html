        <h1>Funnel</h1>
        <p>The funnel can be considered one of the oldest design objects.
        For many reasons it reflects the features, we are looking for when we talk about design.
        It’s able to connect usability with perfect forms and materials.</p>
        <h2>Form</h2>
        <p>It has a simple form that is maybe the key to its success. Basically, it composed on the bottom by a cylindrical part and on the top by a hemispheric. Since when it was born hasn’t been changed, this form is the best to obtain a good result.
            Usually, geometric forms are the best when we made a design object.</p>
        <h2>Usability</h2>
        <p>Thanks to the form it’s very useful. We can use it to channel liquid or fine-grained substances into containers with a large or small opening. Without a funnel, spillage may occur. The final part is long enough to allow a good stabilization of equilibrium and don’t overturn the product itself.</p>
        <h2>Material</h2>
        <p>Funnels are usually made of stainless steel, aluminum, glass, or plastic. The material used in its construction should be sturdy enough to withstand the weight of the substance being transferred, and it should not react with the substance. Usually, the materials allow funnels to be very light to transport and resistant to the hight temperature. Thanks to them we don’t get burnt when hot liquid get through a tunnel. When holding it we just feel warm temperature.
        However, this perfect combination of material isn’t expensive.</p>
