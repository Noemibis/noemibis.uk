        <h1>Cup</h1>
        <p>Cups are also an old and daily object used for drinking and carrying drinks. It can be made of wood, plastic, glass, clay, metal, stone, china or other materials, and it might have a stem, handles or other adornments. Different styles of cups may be used for different liquids or in different situations. But this one, I think is a very piece of design.</p>
        <h2>Material</h2>
        <p>It’s made from ceramic so is possible take it and don’t get burn. For the same reason, the handle is also made from ceramic. This material keeps worm the hot liquid inside during the time and works as a thermal container. Anyway, is easy to take the cup because isn’t slippery. The surface is enough big to hold it with two hands, sticking them like a puzzle to the handle.</p>
        <h2>Style</h2>
        <p>This object represents a good geometric form. It seems like an irregular cylinder with one bigger circumference for the top part and to the bottom one smaller circumference to place itself firmly on the surface.
        To get an easier drinking it has a good handle that allows you to insert two-three fingers inside to grasp firmly it. The handle has a strategic form similar to a hook to be comfortable to hold.</p>
        <h2>Color</h2>
        <p>The color is unique, is one of the key colors of modern design so made this cup appealing to a minimalist or modern types of furniture. Anyway, the important thing is the color inside, because it changes with an opposite one. Inside this cup is totally white to allow seeing inside it and to understand if there are more liquid inside or is empty.
        Perfect connection between functionality and design.</p>
