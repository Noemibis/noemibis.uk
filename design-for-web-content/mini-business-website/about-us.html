                    <p>A nutritious, balanced diet, along with physical activity and refraining from smoking, is the foundation of good health. Healthy eating includes consuming high-quality proteins, carbohydrates, heart-healthy fats, vitamins, minerals and water. Clark&rsquo;s Healthy food will help you with that because we selected the best ingredients for our products and the best staff to do that. We have recently introduced our healthy experts training, to specialise in key areas such as sports nutrition, natural beauty, supplements or food. This is because we want to give you the best.
